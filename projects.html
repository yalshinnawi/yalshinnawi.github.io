                                    The goal of this project was to design and implement a 3-stage pipelined Central Processing Unit (CPU) using the
                                    RISC-V
                                    ISA programmed in Verilog to run on a Zynq 7000-series FPGA. In addition to having a processor that could run
                                    the base
                                    RV32 instruction set, there had to also be separate modules in the datapath for handling input/output (IO) to
                                    transmit
                                    and receive data.

                                    An on-chip Universial Asynchronous Reciever-Transmitter (UART) using the technique of Memory
                                    Mapped IO
                                    (MMIO) was to be implemented to send and receive bytes using RISC-V load and store instructions. This interface
                                    would
                                    then allow the CPU to store the userâ€™s instructions into BIOS memory which could then be read on the following
                                    cycle
                                    instead of reading from Instruction Memory (IMEM).

                        The processor was divided into 3 sections, the Instruction Fetch Stage (IF Stage), Instruction Decode and Execute
                        Stage
                        (IDEX Stage), and Memory Write Back Stage (MEMWB Stage). In the IF Stage, new instructions are loaded from either
                        the
                        IMEM or BIOS which are then decoded and passed through the Register File (RegFile) to load data for the IDEX Stage.
                        The
                        IDEX Stage then passes this data through combinational submodules such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) or Branch
                        Comparator to compute the logic of the current instruction. Output from this stage is saved to the IMEM and Data
                        Memory
                        (DMEM) which is then passed through to the MEMWB Stage. Following this, the MEMWB Stage handles what data is to be
                        written back to the RegFile for the current instruction.

                                    In terms of the original goal, the CPU checked all the marks. The entire datapath was implemented with a 3-stage
                                    pipeline that could send and receive data through the UART MMIO interface. Through this interface, the CPU was able
                                    to
                                    interact with on-board buttons, switches, LEDS, and the audio output with the Subtractive Synthesizer.

                                    By the final checkpoint, the processor was able to reach a clock speed of ~70MHz. The max path delay turned out to
                                    be in
                                    the IDEX Stage of the 3-stage pipeline. Specifically the delay was between the initial instruction input to the IDEX
                                    Stage to the Synthesizer block at the end of this stage. It is speculated that this delay occurs because of the need
                                    for
                                    signed multiplication and buffer that exists in the PWM block for delivering audio to the on-board audio port.
                                    Multiplication is a very intensive process and the current method used in this design is not optimal.

                                    Additionally, it is important to mention that before implementing the NCO, PWM and Synthesizer, the critical path
                                    instead existed between the MEMWB stage and IDEX stage during forwarding. In the previous design we had reached a
                                    final
                                    clock speed of ~76MHz. It is believed that this critical path existed because of the need for the RegFile return
                                    address
                                    and write enable from 2 cycles ago.

                                    For both designs, the CPI of the mmult program was ~1.18 most likely due to the designâ€™s scheme of handling jumps
                                    and
                                    branch instructions by simply adding a NOP to the next cycle. The minimum clock period for the final design was
                                    0.214s
                                    for the mmult program, the number of Slice LUTs used was 2,283, and the number of Slice Registers used was 905.

                                    into
                                    the desired one, attempting to mimic what an instructor would do.

                                In order to accomplish our project goals this really required two main components: the mannequin's pose and a plan to
                                move the mannequinâ€™s arms. To acquire the mannequin's pose, we used Baxter's head camera and arUco markers. We chose to
                                use arUco tags because they make it possible to get the three dimensional position of the tag using only one camera.
                                They are also fairly well documented and there are libraries available to detect arUco markers. While arUco tags may be
                                a bit cumbersome for a user in a real life scenario they offer a simple and well tested solution for defining the
                                location of objects in 3D space using just one camera. In future iterations it may make sense to use a RealSense camera
                                or IMUs for pose estimation.
                                Each aspect of the simulation/project design is further discussed below in the Project Details section.

                                    There are several ways to get the pose of a person. Kinect, IMUs, or other sensors might work. We decided to use
                                    arUco
                                    tags from the OpenCV library. These are pre-defined tags that allow a single camera to find the frame of the tag
                                    relative to the camera in 3D space. Luckily enough there is already a ROS package for detecting arUco tags. In this
                                    design we ended up using the aruco_detect package. By subscribing to the fiducial_transforms topic published by the
                                    aruco_detect package, we were able to get the frame of the arUco tag on the mannequin's arm in the head_camera
                                    frame.
                                    This pose was then transformed to the base frame using a tf_buffer.

                                    and allow the head_camera to detect the arm.

                                    planning and collision detection. The ultimate reason for using MoveIt instead of simply using an Inverse Kinematics
                                    solver was because initially we had planned to add resistance to HumanBot's arm and the path planner would allow for

                                        and in the case of this demonstration, Baxter lifts HumanBot's arm into a T-Pose position. After the movement is
                                        finished, the pose of the aruco_tag, shown in RVIZ defined in the world frame of Gazebo, is shown to have the

                                        The purpose of a version-control system is to help save different versions of your project periodically so that you
                                        can
                                        go back to previous versions if you mess something up. This control system also allows others to push their own
                                        versions
                                        onto the control-system so that one can collaborate on a project without discarding previous work or modifying it,
                                        you
                                        would instead create a new version.

                                        <mark class="markChange">commit</mark>, <mark class="markChange">rm</mark>, <mark class="markChange">log</mark>, <mark class="markChange">global-log</mark>, <mark class="markChange">find</mark>,

                                        To mimick the tree-like structure of commits that git uses, gitlet used different kinds of objects:
                                        <ul class="ulFormat">
                                            <li> <b>blobs</b>: contents of the files, serving as different versions of a document or project.</li>
                                            <li> <b>trees</b>: data structure made of commit objects that connect to each other through their respective
                                                parent commits.</li>
                                            <li> <b>commits</b>: combinations of log messages, a reference to a tree, references to different blobs,
                                                references to parent commits, and other metadata (commit date, author, commit message, and the commit ID)
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </span>
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                Each blob and commit has a unique integer ID that is created using the same cryptographic hash function
                                SHA-1 (Secure
                                Hash 1) that Git uses. The tree structures are made of commits and these commits reference different blobs
                                which
                                represent versions of the files that the user has. An example of this structure is shown below, where the
                                commit
                                contains the references to the blobs, parent link, the date the commit was made, and version names. The blob
                                contains
                                the data of each file, and both the commits and blobs have their own unique SHA-1 hash value.

                            In this project I implemented a slower version of numpy, called numc in the programming language C. Although the matrix multiplication and power operations are not as fast as numpy, they are still much better than the naive implementations via parallel programming using OpenMP and SIMD. This was a very difficult project, and required a lot of thought to get to the required speedup.

                                        To recreate the functionality of NumPy, the first task was to build a struct in C that could work like matrices do
                                        in
                                        NumPy. Specifically this meant that I had to create functions that could properly take slices from arrays. As easy
                                        as
                                        this sounds, it became quite complicated because of the properties of allocation and deallocation of memory in C.
                                        For
                                        instance, if a slice of a matrix was to be deallocated, that did not mean we should lose reference to the parent
                                        matrix.

                                        Once the matrix structure was properly created, the Python-C interface was then tackled. To work like numPy, I had
                                        to ensure that the user could import NumC into a Python program and use methods from the C implementation in Python.
                                        To implement this, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/c-api/index.html">Python/C API</a> was used to convert
                                        the methods and structs in C into the PyObjects. With this interface, it was easy to test the functionality of the
                                        program and compare it to NumPy. Following this, the add, subtraction, multiplication, negation, absolute value, and
                                        power operations were implemented so that they could be used on NumC matrices.
                                    </span><br>
                                    
                                    <span class="spanFormat">
                                        Next was by far the hardest part of this entire project, which was to optimize the naive implementations of all the
                                        matrix operations. This was done by using SIMD instructions with <a
                                            href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Instrinsic functions</a>. The
                                        addition, subtraction, negation, and absolute value functions were rather simplistic. In contrast, the matrix
                                        multiplication and power operations proved to be much more difficult. I had tried pretty much everything I could
                                        think of on matrix multiply. First I ordered the naive solution loops to
                                        produce a ~21x speedup, and then used openMP to reach a ~87x speedup, though this speedup was very unstable.
                                    </span><br>
                                    
                                    <span class="spanFormat">
                                        Due to this I moved on to methods such as transposing the second matrix and using a loop structure to access the
                                        elements row by row instead of column by column to take advantage of spatial locality. I also implemented cache
                                        blocking
                                        on my O(n^2) solution by transposing the matrix. Following that I used openMP, but in the end I was only able to
                                        reach a
                                        ~42x speedup. This wasnâ€™t good enough so I moved onto the last method I tried, which was trying to only use Intel
                                        Instrinsic stores with SIMD on
                                        the outermost loop because the store instruction is very costly. To do so, I used a trick where I created an array
                                        of SIMD vectors the size of the result matrixâ€™s
                                        (column size / 4). I first created a naive solution without SIMD and openMP, and it came out to produce a ~15x
                                        speedup which was pretty bad, but then after a long time I was able to figure out how to convert the structure using
                                        SIMD.
                                        With this I got ~45x speed, and then I used openMP and parallelized the outermost loop and was able to get a ~65x
                                        speedup.
                                        Then, I unrolled the innermost loop a little more, which proved to be difficult, and I was able to reach a ~98x
                                        speedup.

                                        Then for power, I was aware that there was a O(log(n)) solution for normal exponentiation (e.g. x^y), so I tried to
                                        replicate that using matrices. This was quite difficult because I needed to create a lot of different temporary
                                        matrices
                                        to store values, but eventually I figured out how to create a solution that is most likely O(log(n) * n^3) using the
                                        previous matrix multiplication function that was explained.
