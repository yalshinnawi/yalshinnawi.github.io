                            The goal of this project was to design and implement a 3-stage pipelined Central Processing Unit (CPU) using the
                            RISC-V
                            ISA programmed in Verilog to run on a Zynq 7000-series FPGA. In addition to having a processor that could run
                            the base
                            RV32 instruction set, there had to also be separate modules in the datapath for handling input/output (IO) to
                            transmit
                            and receive data. An on-chip Universial Asynchronous Reciever-Transmitter (UART) using the technique of Memory
                            Mapped IO
                            (MMIO) was to be implemented to send and receive bytes using RISC-V load and store instructions. This interface
                            would
                            then allow the CPU to store the user’s instructions into BIOS memory which could then be read on the following
                            cycle
                            instead of reading from Instruction Memory (IMEM).

                            The processor was divided into 3 sections, the Instruction Fetch Stage (IF Stage), Instruction Decode and Execute Stage
                            (IDEX Stage), and Memory Write Back Stage (MEMWB Stage). In the IF Stage, new instructions are loaded from either the
                            IMEM or BIOS which are then decoded and passed through the Register File (RegFile) to load data for the IDEX Stage. The
                            IDEX Stage then passes this data through combinational submodules such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) or Branch
                            Comparator to compute the logic of the current instruction. Output from this stage is saved to the IMEM and Data Memory
                            (DMEM) which is then passed through to the MEMWB Stage. Following this, the MEMWB Stage handles what data is to be
                            written back to the RegFile for the current instruction.

                                In terms of the original goal, the CPU checked all the marks. The entire datapath was implemented with a 3-stage
                                pipeline that could send and receive data through the UART MMIO interface. Through this interface, the CPU was able to
                                interact with on-board buttons, switches, LEDS, and the audio output with the Subtractive Synthesizer.

                            <span>
                                By the final checkpoint, the processor was able to reach a clock speed of ~70MHz. The max path delay turned out to be in
                                the IDEX Stage of the 3-stage pipeline. Specifically the delay was between the initial instruction input to the IDEX
                                Stage to the Synthesizer block at the end of this stage. It is speculated that this delay occurs because of the need for
                                signed multiplication and buffer that exists in the PWM block for delivering audio to the on-board audio port.
                                Multiplication is a very intensive process and the current method used in this design is not optimal.

                            <span>
                                Additionally, it is important to mention that before implementing the NCO, PWM and Synthesizer, the critical path
                                instead existed between the MEMWB stage and IDEX stage during forwarding. In the previous design we had reached a final
                                clock speed of ~76MHz. It is believed that this critical path existed because of the need for the RegFile return address
                                and write enable from 2 cycles ago.

                                For both designs, the CPI of the mmult program was ~1.18 most likely due to the design’s scheme of handling jumps and
                                branch instructions by simply adding a NOP to the next cycle. The minimum clock period for the final design was 0.214s
                                for the mmult program, the number of Slice LUTs used was 2,283, and the number of Slice Registers used was 905.
