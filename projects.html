                                The goal of this project was to design and implement a 3-stage pipelined Central Processing Unit (CPU) using the
                                RISC-V
                                ISA programmed in Verilog to run on a Zynq 7000-series FPGA. In addition to having a processor that could run
                                the base
                                RV32 instruction set, there had to also be separate modules in the datapath for handling input/output (IO) to
                                transmit
                                and receive data. An on-chip Universial Asynchronous Reciever-Transmitter (UART) using the technique of Memory
                                Mapped IO
                                (MMIO) was to be implemented to send and receive bytes using RISC-V load and store instructions. This interface
                                would
                                then allow the CPU to store the userâ€™s instructions into BIOS memory which could then be read on the following
                                cycle
                                instead of reading from Instruction Memory (IMEM).

                        The processor was divided into 3 sections, the Instruction Fetch Stage (IF Stage), Instruction Decode and Execute
                        Stage
                        (IDEX Stage), and Memory Write Back Stage (MEMWB Stage). In the IF Stage, new instructions are loaded from either
                        the
                        IMEM or BIOS which are then decoded and passed through the Register File (RegFile) to load data for the IDEX Stage.
                        The
                        IDEX Stage then passes this data through combinational submodules such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) or Branch
                        Comparator to compute the logic of the current instruction. Output from this stage is saved to the IMEM and Data
                        Memory
                        (DMEM) which is then passed through to the MEMWB Stage. Following this, the MEMWB Stage handles what data is to be
                        written back to the RegFile for the current instruction.

                                In terms of the original goal, the CPU checked all the marks. The entire datapath was implemented with a 3-stage
                                pipeline that could send and receive data through the UART MMIO interface. Through this interface, the CPU was able to
                                interact with on-board buttons, switches, LEDS, and the audio output with the Subtractive Synthesizer.

                            <span>
                                By the final checkpoint, the processor was able to reach a clock speed of ~70MHz. The max path delay turned out to be in
                                the IDEX Stage of the 3-stage pipeline. Specifically the delay was between the initial instruction input to the IDEX
                                Stage to the Synthesizer block at the end of this stage. It is speculated that this delay occurs because of the need for
                                signed multiplication and buffer that exists in the PWM block for delivering audio to the on-board audio port.
                                Multiplication is a very intensive process and the current method used in this design is not optimal.

                            <span>
                                Additionally, it is important to mention that before implementing the NCO, PWM and Synthesizer, the critical path
                                instead existed between the MEMWB stage and IDEX stage during forwarding. In the previous design we had reached a final
                                clock speed of ~76MHz. It is believed that this critical path existed because of the need for the RegFile return address
                                and write enable from 2 cycles ago.

                                For both designs, the CPI of the mmult program was ~1.18 most likely due to the designâ€™s scheme of handling jumps and
                                branch instructions by simply adding a NOP to the next cycle. The minimum clock period for the final design was 0.214s
                                for the mmult program, the number of Slice LUTs used was 2,283, and the number of Slice Registers used was 905.

                                This project was inspired by real world challenges that have been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of social
                                distancing precautions people are unable to participate in typical yoga classes. Yoga instructors often have to put
                                their hands on their students in order to help them with their poses.

                                This project attempts to use the popular Rethink Robotics robot Baxter as a makeshift yoga instructor. The goal of this
                                project is to correct a person's pose. Baxter reaches out and nudges the person's arms from their original position into
                                the desired one, attempting to mimic what an instructor would do.

                                The overall goal of the project was to correct a person's body position using Baxter. More specifically, in our initial
                                project proposal we planned to move someoneâ€™s arms into the YMCA poses, but after we began to work through the project
                                we had to tone this down quite a bit. As a result, our goal turned into just getting Baxter to move someoneâ€™s arms into
                                a T-Pose position as shown in the figure.

                            move the mannequinâ€™s arms. To acquire the mannequin's pose, we used Baxter's head camera and arUco markers. We chose to
                            use arUco tags because they make it possible to get the three dimensional position of the tag using only one camera.
                            They are also fairly well documented and there are libraries available to detect arUco markers. While arUco tags may be
                            a bit cumbersome for a user in a real life scenario they offer a simple and well tested solution for defining the
                            location of objects in 3D space using just one camera. In future iterations it may make sense to use a RealSense camera
                            or IMUs for pose estimation.
                            Each aspect of the simulation/project design is further discussed below in the Project Details section.

                        <p>
                            There are several ways to get the pose of a person. Kinect, IMUs, or other sensors might work. We decided to use arUco
                            tags from the OpenCV library. These are pre-defined tags that allow a single camera to find the frame of the tag
                            relative to the camera in 3D space. Luckily enough there is already a ROS package for detecting arUco tags. In this
                            design we ended up using the aruco_detect package. By subscribing to the fiducial_transforms topic published by the
                            aruco_detect package, we were able to get the frame of the arUco tag on the mannequin's arm in the head_camera frame.
                            This pose was then transformed to the base frame using a tf_buffer.

                        <p>
                            HumanBot is the name that we gave the mannequin. HumanBot is defined by a urdf.xacro file. This file defines his links,
                            joints, and physics.
                            
                            HumanBotâ€™s arms defined to move up and down so that they can be relocated by Baxter. Additionally, as can be seen in the
                            picture to the right, there are two arUco tags on the mannequin's arms. These are modeled as fixed joints onto the arm
                            and allow the head_camera to detect the arm.

                            Finally, with this new pose from the aruco_detect package we were able to use the MoveIt package to handle the path
                            planning and collision detection. The ultimate reason for using MoveIt instead of simply using an Inverse Kinematics
                            solver was because initially we had planned to add resistance to HumanBot's arm and the path planner would allow for
                            a
                            sense of control as the robot continues to move the arms.

                                    In the end we were able to successfully use Baxter to move the HumanBotâ€™s arms. However, there are many improvements to
                                    be made as mentioned at the end of the Design section. The final product used manual inputs to move the HumanBotâ€™s arms,
                                    but we were able to find the exact location of the aruco_tag as shown in the next section

                                    In the video, it first shows in RVIZ how Baxterâ€™s head_camera can target and get the pose of an aruco tag. This is shown
                                    in the bottom left corner of the screen. Using the pose of the tag, Baxter can then plan his movement to the HumanBot
                                    and in the case of this demonstration, Baxter lifts HumanBot's arm into a T-Pose position. After the movement is
                                    finished, the pose of the aruco_tag, shown in RVIZ defined in the world frame of Gazebo, is shown to have the same pose
                                    as the calculated pose in the terminal.

                                With the inspiration of the popular system Git, I created a smaller and simpler version-control system named Gitlet in CS61B at UC Berkeley. A version-control system is a backup system for collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Saving the contents of entire directories of files.</li>
                                    <li>Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits.</li>
                                    <li>Viewing the history of your backups via a log.</li>
                                    <li>Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.</li>
                                    <li>Merging changes in one branch into another.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    The purpose of a version-control system is to help save different versions of your project periodically so that you can
                                    go back to previous versions if you mess something up. This control system also allows others to push their own versions
                                    onto the control-system so that one can collaborate on a project without discarding previous work or modifying it, you
                                    would instead create a new version.

                                    To mimick the tree-like structure of commits that git uses, gitlet used different kinds of objects:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> <b>blobs</b>: contents of the files, serving as different versions of a document or project.</li>

                                        <li> <b>commits</b>: combinations of log messages, a reference to a tree, references to different blobs, references to parent commits, and other metadata (commit date, author, commit message, and the commit ID)</li>
                                    </ul>

                                Each blob and commit has a unique integer ID that is created using the same cryptographic hash function SHA-1 (Secure
                                Hash 1) that Git uses. The tree structures are made of commits and these commits reference different blobs which
                                represent versions of the files that the user has. An example of this structure is shown below, where the commit
                                contains the references to the blobs, parent link, the date the commit was made, and version names. The blob contains
                                the data of each file, and both the commits and blobs have their own unique SHA-1 hash value. Image Credit: <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/materials/proj/proj3/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley CS61B Fall, 2019</a>

                                Much like Git, gitlet is initialized first using init, creating a .gitlet file that contains the head commit which can then be used to branch off and create different versions by adding new files and commiting, or by creating a new branch which will detach from the master branch. This project was a great experience, and really made it easier to understand what Git can really do.

                            In this project I implemented a slower version of numpy, called numc in the programming language C. Although the matrix multiplication and power operations are not as fast as numpy, they are still much better than the naive implementations via parallel programming using OpenMP and SIMD. This was a very difficult project, and required a lot of thought to get to the required speedup.

                                    To recreate the functionality of NumPy, the first task was to build a struct in C that could work like matrices do in
                                    NumPy. Specifically this meant that I had to create functions that could properly take slices from arrays. As easy as
                                    this sounds, it became quite complicated because of the properties of allocation and deallocation of memory in C. For
                                    instance, if a slice of a matrix was to be deallocated, that did not mean we should lose reference to the parent matrix.

                                    Once the matrix structure was properly created, the Python-C interface was then tackled. To work like numPy, I had to ensure that the user could import NumC into a Python program and use methods from the C implementation in Python. To implement this, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/c-api/index.html">Python/C API</a> was used to convert the methods and structs in C into the PyObjects. With this interface, it was easy to test the functionality of the program and compare it to NumPy. Following this, the add, subtraction, multiplication, negation, absolute value, and power operations were implemented so that they could be used on NumC matrices.

                                    Next was by far the hardest part of this entire project, which was to optimize the naive implementations of all the matrix operations. This was done by using SIMD instructions with <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Instrinsic functions</a>. The addition, subtraction, negation, and absolute value functions were rather simplistic. In contrast, the matrix multiplication and power operations proved to be much more difficult. I had tried pretty much everything I could think of on matrix multiply. First I ordered the naive solution loops to
                                    produce a ~21x speedup, and then used openMP to reach a ~87x speedup, though this speedup was very unstable.

                                <span>
                                    Due to this I moved on to methods such as transposing the second matrix and using a loop structure to access the
                                    elements row by row instead of column by column to take advantage of spatial locality. I also implemented cache blocking
                                    on my O(n^2) solution by transposing the matrix. Following that I used openMP, but in the end I was only able to reach a
                                    ~42x speedup. This wasnâ€™t good enough so I moved onto the last method I tried, which was trying to only use Intel Instrinsic stores with SIMD on
                                    the outermost loop because the store instruction is very costly. To do so, I used a trick where I created an array of SIMD vectors the size of the result matrixâ€™s
                                    (column size / 4). I first created a naive solution without SIMD and openMP, and it came out to produce a ~15x
                                    speedup which was pretty bad, but then after a long time I was able to figure out how to convert the structure using SIMD.
                                    With this I got ~45x speed, and then I used openMP and parallelized the outermost loop and was able to get a ~65x speedup.
                                    Then, I unrolled the innermost loop a little more, which proved to be difficult, and I was able to reach a ~98x speedup.

                                    Then for power, I was aware that there was a O(log(n)) solution for normal exponentiation (e.g. x^y), so I tried to
                                    replicate that using matrices. This was quite difficult because I needed to create a lot of different temporary matrices
                                    to store values, but eventually I figured out how to create a solution that is most likely O(log(n) * n^3) using the previous matrix multiplication function that was explained.
